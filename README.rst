Install
=======

Electron
~~~~~~~~

On Ubuntu these packages suffice::

  sudo apt-get install npm nodejs nodejs-legacy

You probably need to do more than this... but here goes::

  echo "prefix = ${HOME}/.local" > $HOME/.npmrc
  npm install -g electron-prebuilt
  
  Add: "$HOME/.local/bin" to your $PATH.

electron-spotify
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Grab the source and run::

  git clone https://github.com/safl/electron-spotify
  electron electron-spotify/app --ppapi-flash-path=${PPAPI_FLASH_PATH} --ppapi-flash-version=${PPAPI_FLASH_VERSION}

Replace ``${PPAPI_FLASH_PATH}`` and ``${PPAPI_FLASH_VERSION}`` with the path and version of your `Pepperflash <https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/using-pepper-flash-plugin.md>`_ plugin. Open ``chrome://plugins`` with Chrome, click ``+ Details``, then you can see the path and version of the currently installed PepperFlash.
